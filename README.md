**What I learned so far**

I learned a lot about dictionaries/nested dictionaries.

- You can't change the size of dictionary during iteration.i.e add/remove entries in dict objects.
        
            quizQuestion = {  
                1:{'question':'The Olympics are held every how many years?',
                    answer:'4'},
                2:{'question':'What does MLB stand for? A: Major League Baseball?',
                    answer:'Major League Baseball'},
                3:{'question':'Which country has won the soccer world cup the most times?',
                    answer:'Brasil'}
                }

            //pseduo-code-ishÂ ðŸ¥´
            for q in quizQuestion:
                if  question_list[q]['question'] == question_list[q]['answer']:
                    del current question
                    print('correct)
                else:
                    del current question
                    print('incorrect') 
            output//
            Runtimeerror: dictionary changed size during iteration
            in this scenerio i used the deepcopy which allowed me to del/update.


- Access tuple values by using index like my_tuple[int].
    Otherwise it will return `TypeError: tuple indices must be integers or slices, not str`.
    I had trouble figuring this part out. I was overwriting quiz dictionary with tuple and trying to access questions using a string.
